Upon issuance of the Letter of Credit, a copy of it shall be attached to this Lease. Landlord reserves the right to periodically review the financial condition of the issuing bank for any Letter of Credit and any renewal or replacement Letter of Credit and if Landlord determines that the issuing bank no longer satisfies the criteria set forth above, Landlord may require a replacement Letter of Credit in form and substance and from a United States bank acceptable to Landlord which satisfies the criteria set forth above. Landlord may draw upon the Letter of Credit at any time Tenant is in default under this Lease without prior notice to Tenant. The Letter of Credit shall have a term of at least <docset:LetterofCreditExpirationDate>12 months</docset:LetterofCreditExpirationDate>, and it shall by its terms be renewed automatically each year by the bank, unless the bank gives written notice to the beneficiary, at least <docset:LetterofCreditReviewPeriod>60 days </docset:LetterofCreditReviewPeriod>before the expiration date of the then existing Letter of Credit, that the bank elects that it not be renewed. If Tenant fails to provide a replacement Letter of Credit because the issuing bank no longer satisfies the criteria set forth above or if the Letter of Credit is ever not renewed and has less than 30 days remaining in its term, Tenant shall be in default of the terms of this Lease and Landlord may draw on the Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit shall be transferable and the proceeds assignable. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all transfer fees incurred. If the financial institution which issued the initial Letter of Credit is ever declared insolvent or closed by the FDIC or other applicable governmental authority or is closed for any other reason (other than periodic branch closures which occur in the normal course of business), then Tenant shall, within 30 days after notice from Landlord, provide a substitute Letter of Credit to Landlord from another financial institution acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion and which otherwise complies with the terms of this section and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord's attorneys' fees and costs incurred. Tenant agrees and acknowledges that Tenant has no property interest whatsoever in the Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof and that, in the event Tenant becomes a debtor under any chapter of the <dg:chunk>Federal Bankruptcy Code</dg:chunk>, neither Tenant, any trustee, nor Tenant's bankruptcy estate shall have any right to restrict or limit Landlord's claim and/or rights to the Letter of Credit and/or the proceeds thereof by application of Section 502(b) (6) of the <dg:chunk>Federal Bankruptcy Code</dg:chunk>. Any cure periods for a default by Tenant under this Lease shall not be applicable to a default by Tenant of the terms of this section. The Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a security deposit under this Lease, but rather as a third-party guaranty by the issuing bank guaranteeing all of the Tenant's obligations under this Lease. For purposes of this Lease, the term “<dg:chunk>Reduction Date</dg:chunk>” shall mean the third anniversary of the <dg:chunk>Commencement Date </dg:chunk>and each annual anniversary thereafter.
