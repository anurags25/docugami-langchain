Upon the date of the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease, a proportionate share of the additional rent payable under this Article 41 for the Escalation Year during which such expiration or termination occurs shall immediately become due and payable by Tenant to Landlord. Said proportionate share shall be based on the length of time that the term of this Lease shall be within such Escalation Year.

amount owed to Landlord shall be made. The obligations of Tenant to pay additional rent as provided for herein shall survive the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination of this Lease.

Pending the resolution of such dispute, Tenant shall pay the additional rent to Landlord in accordance with the statements furnished by Landlord.

Tenant's sole remedy shall be an action or proceeding to enforce any such provision, or for specific performance, injunction or declaratory judgment.
65 . Tenant Waivers
Tenant waives trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim whatsoever brought by Landlord or Tenant arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, Tenant’s use of or occupancy of the Premises, and/or any emergency statutory or any other statutory remedy.

If Tenant timely disputes Landlord’s Determination and Landlord and Tenant fail to agree as to the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (and, accordingly, the Rent payable by Tenant during the subject Renewal Term) within thirty (30) days after the giving of Tenant’s Notice, then the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent shall be determined as follows: A licensed real estate appraiser (the “Appraiser”) shall be selected and paid for jointly by Landlord and Tenant.

The Appraiser's aforesaid choice shall be conclusive and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. Each party shall pay its own counsel fees and expenses, if any, in connection with the procedure described herein, and fifty (50%) percent of any AAA fees and fees of the Appraiser. Either Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to submit to the Appraiser any material in support of its determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent within ten (10) business days of the date of the selection of the Appraiser. After a determination has been made of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent , the parties shall execute and deliver a lease amendment memorializing the extension of the Term as described in this Article 72 and setting forth the Rent payable by Tenant during the Renewal Term , but the failure to so execute and deliver any such instrument shall not affect the determination of Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent (and, accordingly, the Rent payable during the Renewal Term ).
(iii) If Tenant timely disputes Landlord’s Determination and if the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent shall not be made on or before the first day of the subject Renewal Term then, pending such final determination, Tenant shall pay, as Rent for the subject Renewal Term, an amount equal to Landlord’s Determination. If, based upon the final determination of the Fair Market Minimum Annual Rent , the Rent payments made by Tenant for such portion of the subject Renewal Term were (i) less than they should have been, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of such deficiency within ten (10) business days after demand therefor, or (ii) greater than they should have been, then Landlord shall credit the amount of such excess against installments of Rent next coming due.
Time shall be of the essence with respect to all obligations under this Article 72.
