S-4
 Any person making the decision to acquire the notes shall be deemed, on behalf of itself and the holder, by acquiring and holding the notes or exercising any rights related thereto, to represent that:
(i) the funds that the holder is using to acquire the notes are not the assets of an employee benefit plan subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 , as amended (“ERISA”), a plan described in and subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 , as amended (the “Code”), a governmental plan subject to any federal, state or local law that is similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or an entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of Department of Labor regulation section 2510.3- 101 , as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, or otherwise; or

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS SPECIFIC TO YOUR NOTE
Assuming No Changes in Market Conditions and Other Relevant Factors , the Value of Your Note on the Date of This Pricing Supplement (As Determined by Reference to Pricing Models Used by Goldman Sachs ) May Be Significantly Less than the Original Issue Price
The value or quoted price of your note at any time will reflect many factors and cannot be predicted. If Goldman Sachs makes a market in the notes, the price quoted by us or our affiliates for your note would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, including a deterioration in our creditworthiness or perceived creditworthiness whether measured by our credit ratings or other credit measures. These changes may adversely affect the market price of your notes, including the price you may receive for your notes in any market making transaction. In addition, even if our creditworthiness does not decline, the value of your note on the trade date may be significantly less than the original price taking into account our credit spreads on that date. The quoted price could be higher or lower than the original issue price, and may be higher or lower than the value of your note as determined by reference to pricing models used by Goldman Sachs .
If at any time a third party dealer quotes a price to purchase your note or otherwise values your note, that price may be significantly different (higher or lower) than any price quoted by Goldman Sachs . See “Risk Factors — Considerations Relating to Notes Generally — The Market Price of Any Notes We May Issue May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors and If You Buy a Note and Sell It Prior to the Stated Maturity Date , You May Receive Less Than the Face Amount of Your Note ” in the Offering Circular .
Furthermore, if you sell your note, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount.
There is no assurance that Goldman Sachs or any other party will be willing to purchase your note, and in this regard Goldman Sachs is not obligated to make a market in your note. See “Risk Factors—Considerations Relating to Notes Generally—Any Notes We May Issue May Not Have an Active Trading Market ” in the Offering Circular .
The Market
Price of the Notes May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors and If You Sell Your Note Prior to the Stated Maturity Date , You May Receive Less Than the Accreted Value of Your Note
The following factors, most of which are beyond our control, will influence the market price of the notes:
• economic, military, financial, regulatory, political, terrorist and other events that affect securities generally;
• interest and yield rates in the market;
• the time remaining until a note matures; and
• our creditworthiness.
As a result of these and other factors, if you sell your note prior to maturity, you may receive less than the accreted value of your note. Moreover, these factors interrelate in complex ways, and the effect of one factor may offset or enhance the effect of another factor.
The Notes May Not Have an Active Trading Market
We have appointed KGI Securities Co. Ltd. , and KGI Securities Co. Ltd. has agreed to act, as the liquidity provider for providing quotations in respect of the notes listed on the TPEx in accordance with Article 24-1 of the TPEx Rules and the relevant regulations.
Neither we, nor any of our affiliates, have any obligation to make a market in the notes. Even if a secondary market for the notes develops, it may not provide significant liquidity. The transaction costs in any such secondary market may be high. As a result, the difference between bid and asked prices for the note in any secondary market could be substantial.
Listing of the Notes on TPEx
Application will be made for the listing of the notes on the TPEx . No assurance can be given as to whether the notes will be, or will remain, listed on the TPEx . If the notes fail to or cease to be listed on the TPEx , certain investors may not invest in, or continue to hold or invest in, the notes.
We Have the Right to Redeem Your Note at Our Option
On each early redemption date listed above, we will have the option to redeem your notes at a price equal to the product of (i) the face amount outstanding on such early redemption date, multiplied by (ii) the relevant early
S-7 redemption amount listed above which corresponds to such early redemption date, by notice to Euroclear Bank SA/NV and Clearstream Banking , société anonyme, no fewer than five (5) business days prior to the relevant early redemption date. Even if we do not exercise this option, our ability to do so may adversely affect the value of your notes.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
General
 We have agreed to sell to the Lead Manager and the Co-Managers have agreed to buy from us, the face amount of the notes specified on the front cover of this Pricing Supplement . The Lead Manager and each Co-Manager has agreed that it will resell the notes for which it has agreed to subscribe only to “restricted professional investors” (as further described below) in the
R.O.C. at the original issue price applicable to the notes in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act . Any notes sold by the Lead Manager and the Co-Managers to dealers may be resold by such dealers in negotiated transactions or otherwise, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, which prices may be different from the original issue price. To the extent permitted by the laws and regulations of the R.O.C. , in the future, Goldman Sachs International and our other affiliates may repurchase and resell the notes in market- making transactions, with resales being made at prices related to prevailing market prices at the time of resale or at negotiated prices.
The Issuer has appointed Goldman Sachs International (the " Settlement Agent ") to act as its agent to facilitate the settlement of the notes in the primary market. The Settlement Agent will not subscribe for the notes in the primary market or receive the subscription monies for the primary sale of the notes by the Issuer other than in its capacity as Settlement Agent .
The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons (as those terms are defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act ) unless an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. In particular, hedging transactions involving the notes may not be conducted other than in compliance with the Securities Act . Each purchaser of a note is deemed to agree to comply with the foregoing.

The Lead Manager and the Co-Managers will receive a fee of 0.10% of the face amount of the notes in connection with the sale of the notes.

The following is a summary of certain R.O.C. taxation consequences with respect to the holders of the notes, and is prepared based on current R.O.C. laws and regulations. It does not purport to be comprehensive and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Investors (particularly those subject to special tax rules, such as banks, dealers, insurance companies and tax-exempt entities) should consult with their own tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the notes.
Interest on the Notes
As the Issuer of the notes is not an R.O.C. statutory tax withholder, there is no R.O.C. withholding tax on the interest to be paid on the notes.
R.O.C. corporate holders must include the interest or deemed interest receivable under the notes as part of their taxable income and pay income tax at a flat rate of 20 per cent . (unless the total taxable income for a fiscal year is under $500,000 New Taiwan Dollars ) , as they are subject to income tax on their worldwide income on an accrual basis. The alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) is not applicable.
Sale of the Notes
In general, the sale of corporate bonds or financial bonds is subject to 0.1 per cent . securities transaction tax (“STT”) on the transaction price. However, Article 2-1 of the Securities Transaction Tax Act prescribes that STT will cease to be levied on the sale of corporate bonds and financial bonds from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2026 . Therefore, the sale of the notes will be exempt from STT if the sale is conducted on or before 31 December 2026 . Starting from 1 January 2027 , any sale of the notes will be subject to STT at 0.1 per cent. of the transaction price, unless otherwise provided by the tax laws that may be in force at that time.
Capital gains generated from the sale of bonds are exempt from R.O.C. income tax. Accordingly, R.O.C. corporate holders are not subject to income tax on any capital gains generated from the sale of the notes. However,
R.O.C. corporate holders should include the capital gains from the sale of the notes in calculating their basic income for the purpose of calculating their AMT. If the amount of the AMT exceeds the annual income tax calculated pursuant to the Income Basic Tax Act (also known as the AMT Act ), the excess becomes the R.O.C. corporate holders’ AMT payable. Capital losses, if any, incurred by R.O.C. corporate holders could be carried over 5 years to offset against capital gains of same category of income for the purposes of calculating their AMT.
Non- R.O.C.
corporate holders with a fixed place of business (e.g., a branch) or a business agent in the R.O.C. are not subject to income tax on any capital gains generated from the sale of the notes. However, their fixed place of business or business agent should include any such capital gains in calculating their basic income for the purpose of calculating AMT.
As to non- R.O.C. corporate holders without a fixed place of business and a business agent in the R.O.C. , they are not subject to income tax or AMT on any capital gains generated from the sale of the notes.
R.O.C. Settlement and Trading
Initial subscription of the notes by investors will be settled directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. In order to purchase the notes, an investor may use an account with Euroclear or Clearstream , Luxembourg and settle the notes through such account with Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg . For any
R.O.C. investor having its own account with Euroclear or Clearstream , Luxembourg, the distributions of principal and/or interest for the notes to such holders will be made to its own account with Euroclear or Clearstream , Luxembourg.
Investors having a securities book-entry account with an R.O.C. securities broker and a foreign currency deposit account with an R.O.C. bank , may request the approval of the Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation (“ TDCC” ) to the settlement of the notes through the account of TDCC with Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg if such approval is granted by the TDCC , the notes may be so cleared and settled. Under such circumstances, TDCC will allocate the respective book-entry interest of such investor in the notes to the securities book-entry account designated by such investor in the
R.O.C. The notes will be traded and settled pursuant to the applicable rules and operating procedures of TDCC and the TPEx as domestic bonds. Additionally, such investor may apply to TDCC (by filing in a prescribed form) to transfer the notes in its own account with Euroclear or Clearstream , Luxembourg to such TDCC account with Euroclear or Clearstream , Luxembourg for trading in the domestic market or vice versa for trading in overseas markets.
For the investors who hold their interest in the notes through an account opened and held by TDCC with Euroclear or Clearstream , Luxembourg, distributions of principal and/or interest for the notes to such holders may be made by payment services banks whose systems are connected to TDCC to the foreign currency deposit accounts of the holders. Such payment is expected to be made on the second Taiwanese business day following TDCC 's receipt of such payment (due to time difference, the payment is expected to be received by TDCC one Taiwanese business day after the distribution date). However, when the holders will actually receive such distributions may vary depending upon the daily operations of the
R.O.C. banks with which the holder has the foreign currency deposit account.
