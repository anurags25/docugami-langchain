1. Protocol Synopsis
Title of Study :
A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Glucodynamics of LY900014 compared to Humalog in Patients with T2DM
Rationale:
LY900014 is an ultra-rapid acting insulin lispro formulation with increased early absorption compared to commercially available insulin lispro formulation ( Humalog, Eli Lilly ) . LY900014 aims to mimic the physiological prandial insulin secretion pattern, which may more effectively control postprandial glucose excursions and allow increased flexibility of the time of dosing relative to a meal.
The aim of this study is to compare the insulin lispro pharmacokinetic (PK), glucodynamic (GD), and tolerability profiles of insulin lispro following administration of either LY900014 or Humalog during a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Objectives/Endpoints:

Abbreviations:
AE = adverse event; AUC(0 - 30min ) = area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to 30 minutes ; ∆AUC = area under the baseline subtracted glucose concentration versus time curve; early 50% tmax = time to early half-maximal drug concentration; GD = glucodynamics; MMTT = mixed meal tolerance test ; PK = pharmacokinetics; SC = subcutaneous; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Summary of Study Design :
Study I8B-MC-ITRW is a Phase 1, randomized, patient and investigator blind, 2 -treatment, 4 -period crossover study to evaluate meal to dose-timing in patients with T2DM.
Treatment Arms and Planned Duration for an Individual patient:
Patients will be screened over a 14-day period prior to start of an approximate 2-week lead-in/ insulin transition period. Patients will then participate in a dose-finding assessment (Day -1 of Period 1 ) and subsequently randomised to 1 of 4 treatment sequences according to the actual randomization table provided to the site. In each study period, patients will undergo an MMTT. Each patient will receive a single subcutaneous injection of either LY900014 or Humalog either immediately before the test meal or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal. All treatment procedures will be inpatient stays of approximately 2 days per period and require a maximum of 6 weeks to complete 4 periods. Each study dosing will be separated by a minimum of 21 hours and may occur on consecutive visits, however patient inclusion is subject to required screening criteria. The follow-up or early discontinuation visit should occur at least 14 days after the last dose of the study drug.
Treatment:
LY900014 :
Single individualized SC dose per assessment period
Humalog :
Single individualized SC dose per assessment period
Number of Patients:
Up to 36 patients may be enrolled to ensure that at least 30 patients will complete the study . Thirty completing patients will provide greater than 95% power to demonstrate a 2 - fold increase in the serum insulin lispro AUC(0- 30min ) between LY900014 and Humalog when both are given immediately before meals.
Statistical Analysis :
Primary statistical analyses of PK and GD parameters will be conducted on the set of patients who complete all treatment periods. Supportive analyses may be done on the key parameters for the patients who complete at least the first period of treatment. Safety analyses will be conducted on the set of patients receiving at least 1 dose of the study drug to which they are randomized, regardless of whether or not they complete all protocol requirements.
Unless otherwise noted, all tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 , and confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated at 95% , 2-sided.
Safety:
 All investigational product and protocol procedure AEs will be listed, and if the frequency of events allows, safety data will be summarized using descriptive methodology. Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics.
Pharmacokinetic:
Log-transformed AUCs, Cmax, CL/F and Vz/F for insulin lispro will be evaluated to estimate geometric means, ratios of geometric means of insulin lispro within LY900014 to Humalog , and the corresponding 95% CIs of the ratios using the mixed-effects model that includes treatment and period as fixed effects and patient as a random effect.
The same model without log transformation will be used for the analysis of the PK time parameters (early 50% tmax, late 50% tmax, tmax, and t1/2). Least-squares means (LSmeans), treatment differences in LSmeans, and the corresponding 95% CIs for the treatment differences will be estimated from the model. The p-value on the difference between LS means will be used to determine statistical significance. The treatment ratios and 95% CIs for the ratios will be calculated using Fieller ’s theorem.
Glucodynamic:
Data will be analyzed for the patients during each MMTT. The change from baseline values (the average of -30 , -15 , and 0 minutes ) represented as the 0 - hour time point following the start of the MMTT for each patient will be calculated. The area under the baseline subtracted glucose concentration versus time curve from time
0 to 2hr ( ∆AUC[0 - 2h ]) and area under the baseline subtracted glucose concentration versus time curve from time
0 to 5hr post meal ( ∆AUC[0 -5h]) will be calculated. In addition, the change from baseline maximum glucose observed during the 5 hours postmeal and change from baseline 1 -hour glucose and 2 - hour glucose post the start of the meal will be calculated. Other partial ∆AUCs may be calculated as deemed appropriate.
Summary statistics will be presented by treatment and by timing of dose (all 4 combinations of treatment and timing of dose). The GD parameters on the original scale will be analyzed using the mixed-effects model that includes treatment, timing of dose, treatment-by-timing of dose interaction, and period as fixed effects and patient as a random effect.
The p-value on the difference between LS means will be used to determine statistical significance and the corresponding 95% CIs for the LS Mean ratios from Fieller ’s theorem will be presented.

3. Introduction
3.1. Study Rationale
A prandial insulin with faster-on and/or faster-off characteristics might reduce glycemic excursions and the incidence of postprandial hypoglycemia compared to currently available fast-acting insulin analogs. LY900014 is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin lispro formulation that has shown an increased early absorption compared to commercially available insulin lispro ( Humalog ®; Eli Lilly ). LY900014 aims to closely mimic the physiological prandial insulin secretion pattern, which may more effectively control postprandial glucose excursions and allow increased flexibility of the time of dosing relative to a meal. This study aims to compare PK and PD profiles as well as the improved action of insulin lispro from LY900014 on the control of postprandial blood glucose in comparison to Humalog in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The improved action of insulin lispro will be assessed by using standardized mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Furthermore, this study will explore the postprandial glucose profiles with LY900014 and Humalog injected at 2 different meal-to-dose time intervals either immediately before or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal to optimize future use of this investigational medicinal product (IMP).
3.2. Background
The insulin analog insulin lispro ( Humalog ) has been shown to be absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin ( Humalog package insert, 2015 ). In healthy volunteers given subcutaneous (SC) doses of insulin lispro ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 units/kg, peak serum levels were seen 30 to 90 minutes after dosing ( Humalog package insert, 2015 ). However, the general consensus is that rapid-acting insulin is still not rapid enough to match carbohydrate absorption profiles, which limits efficacy and dosing flexibility. An ultra-rapid-acting prandial insulin would shift the PK/glucodynamics (GD) of insulin analogs so that they have an even faster onset to better match carbohydrate absorption and also allow greater flexibility in the time of dosing relative to meals.
LY900014 represents a new formulation that contains insulin lispro , treprostinil , citrate, and other excipients. This formulation involves the novel use of a microdose of treprostinil
as an excipient to enhance the absorption of insulin lispro by local vasodilatation rather than as an active pharmaceutical ingredient to elicit a systemic effect. Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue, administered either through inhalation ), as an intravenous (IV) infusion or as a continuous SC administration for the treatment of symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and has been approved in the US since 2002 and in Germany since 2006 (AMIS database [WWW]). Sodium citrate, an excipient that speeds insulin absorption (at least in part by enhancing vascular permeability), is also included in the formulation to further enhance the absorption of insulin lispro . Each of the other excipients (such as magnesium chloride ) in the LY900014 formulation is listed in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 's Generally Recognized as Safe Food Additives database and in the FDA 's Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database. Furthermore, the excipient concentration in LY900014 is within the limits identified for approved drug products in the FDA 's Inactive Ingredients in Approved Drugs database.
To date, LY900014 has been administered to approximately 89 patients with diabetes ( 60 T1DM and 29 T2DM) across 3 Phase 1b studies and approximately 107 healthy volunteers across these Phase 1 studies. The total insulin lispro exposure was similar between LY900014 and Humalog ; however LY900014 demonstrated a faster and earlier insulin lispro absorption compared to Humalog . Additionally, through the use of multiple daily injections of LY900014 in patients for up to 2 weeks with either T1DM or T2DM, it was found that LY900014 was well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study treatment or discontinuations from the studies because of a drug-related AE. Small numbers of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported, and there were no notable increases in these events in relation to any of the LY900014 formulations compared to those in relation to Humalog . There were no reported cases of severe hypoglycemia . Additionally, there were no reported incidences of local or systemic allergic reactions.
3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
This study will not offer any direct benefits to the patients participating in the study . The data from previous studies in healthy subjects and patients with T1DM and T2DM have shown that LY900014 was well tolerated and the adverse drug reactions are in keeping with those reported for Humalog . Potential risks associated with LY900014, derived from the known risks of insulin lispro ( Humalog ), are hypoglycemia , hypersensitivity reactions (localized allergy and/or systemic allergy ), undesirable effects at the injection site (injection-site reactions and lipodystrophy ), and peripheral edema ( Humalog package insert, 2015 ). Notably, across all doses in the studies that have evaluated treprostinil as a local vasodilator with or without insulin lispro , there was no clinically significant increase in those AEs associated with systemic absorption of treprostinil , as described in the package insert ( 2014 ). The exposures of treprostinil in LY900014 in this study are expected to be undetectable compared to those observed in the dose ranges previously explored with SC bolus administration of treprostinil and are expected to be substantially lower than those observed in the treatment of PAH. No known potential risks are associated with the use of small amounts of treprostinil in the LY900014 formulation. In preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicity studies, or clinical pharmacology studies involving LY900014 or treprostinil alone, other than known risks associated with Humalog and
, no additional risks were identified. Additionally, local and systemic toxicity profiles of Humalog and do not suggest the potential for additive or synergistic toxicity. The study includes inpatient procedures during which participants will be continuously monitored. Patients will be without food intake from the start of the MMTT to completion of blood collection (approximately 420 minutes ) unless required to treat hypoglycemia , (see Section 9.5.6.2 for definition of hypoglycemia and Section 9.5.8 for treatment guidelines). If a patient
experiences elevated blood glucose following food intake for more than 1 hour , insulin glulisine will be administered intravenously (see Section 9.5.8 for treatment guidelines). Patients will maintain their basal insulin regimen of site-provided insulin glargine during the entire study including the MMTT days unless safety issues arise; in this case, the investigator will discuss a change of the basal insulin regimen with the sponsor clinical pharmacologist (CP) and implement this change, if necessary, to prevent any medical problems.
More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, SAEs, and reasonably anticipated AEs of LY900014 are to be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

Patients will be required to attend the CRU on at least 8 occasions (no more than 10 occasions if dose-finding and/or one MMTT rescheduled) as noted in the Study Schedule (see Section 2):
• Informed consent
• Screening visit
• Lead-in and insulin transition period (see Section 9.2.1 )
• 4 inpatient CRU study visits (including dose finding assessment [see Section 9.2.2 )
• A follow-up visit.
Eligible patients who have satisfied the entry criteria and completed all screening procedures will return to the CRU at least 2 weeks prior to Period 1 Day -2 to begin a lead-in and insulin transition period. When patients visit the CRU to begin the lead-in period, patients will receive instruction on general diabetes education including measurement of self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and receive instruction on the insulin transition (see Section 9.2.1). During the insulin transition period, patients will transition from their current basal insulin therapy to
Following insulin
transition, patients will return to the CRU for the dose-finding assessment (see Section 9.2.2) either on the evening of Day -2 or the morning of Day -1 Period 1. The dose-finding assessment will use Humalog administered immediately before a standardized liquid test meal ( MMTT ) to inform the dose of LY900014 and Humalog to be used during subsequent study MMTT assessments. Upon completion of the dose-finding assessment, patients will be randomised to 1 of 4 treatment sequences. Prior to the MMTT in each study period, patients will undergo a run-in period (see Section 9.2.3.1) to achieve a predetermined glucose target of 135 + 15 mg/dL (7.5+0.8 mmol/L). Once the glucose target has been attained, patients will proceed with the MMTT in which a single individualized SC dose of LY900014 or Humalog will be administered either immediately before the test meal or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal (see Section
9.2.3.2 ).
Doses of LY900014 and Humalog during the 4 study periods will be separated by a minimum washout of approximately 21 hours . The maximum duration allowed for all 4 periods is approximately 6 weeks . Patients will continue using site-provided Humalog and insulin glargine during the washout periods between MMTTs (see Section 7.7 for use of concomitant medication and basal insulin ). During the washout periods, patients will be instructed to perform regular blood glucose monitoring (see Section 9.5.6.4.).
Following completion of all study procedures in each period, patients may be offered a meal and discharged from the CRU at the discretion of the principal investigator.
Study governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3.
5.2. Number of Participants
Up to 36 patients may be enrolled so that approximately 30 patients complete the study . For purposes of this study , a patient completes the study when all scheduled procedures shown in the Schedule of Activities have been finished. Patients who drop out may be replaced, the replacement patient will adopt all 4 assigned crossover treatments of the original patient's randomization schedule.
5.3. End of Study Definition
End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2) for the last patient.
5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The study is a 4-period crossover design to reduce the variability of insulin PK and GD as each patient will act as his/her own control. The total number of patients needed with a crossover design is less than the number needed with a parallel group design. A maximum duration of approximately 6 weeks is allowed for patients to complete all 4 assigned periods to minimize the risk of insulin resistance/changes in mean glycemic control during the study . Randomization and blinding are used to avoid bias introduced through an association between allocation order of IMP and patient characteristics. The Lilly CP / Lilly study team will be unblinded. In each study period, patients will undergo a run-in period before the MMTT using a variable insulin and glucose intravenous (IV) infusion. This run-in period will allow for improved comparability of the postprandial glucose response to a mixed meal after treatment with LY900014 and Humalog administered either immediately before the start of the meal, or 20 minutes following the start of the test meal. This run-in aims to achieve similar preprandial glucose levels for all patients before the start of the test meal and thereby reduces the variability of the postprandial glucose response. Insulin glulisine has been chosen for the IV optimization of blood glucose during the run-in because insulin glulisine does not cross-react with the insulin lispro –specific assay used for the PK analysis. Under this design, if 2 periods occur on consecutive days, the interval between the last bolus on the first day and the first bolus on the second day is much longer compared to the length of time that the treatment ( LY900014 or Humalog ) lasts in the bloodstream; therefore, no carryover effect is assumed. This enables PK and GD data from the breakfast meal tests of each period to be analyzed independently and separately. A minimum of approximately 21 hours washout between the test meals allows for a complete washout of study drug administered with the MMTT and glucose response and prevents carry- over effects.
5.5. Justification for Dose
The bolus dose of insulin lispro ( LY900014 or Humalog ) will be individualized per patient to cover the carbohydrate content in this standardized liquid test meal. This dose of insulin is reflective of clinically relevant, individualized insulin dosing, similar to how patients would determine the insulin dose for the carbohydrate content in a meal. For each patient, the individualized prandial insulin lispro dose in LY900014 and Humalog for each test meal must be kept identical throughout the crossover periods.
6. Study Population
Eligibility of patients for study enrollment will be based on the results of screening medical history, physical examination , vital signs , clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram ( ECG ).
The nature of any conditions present at the time of the physical examination and any preexisting conditions will be documented.
Screening may occur over a 14-day period prior to the lead-in site visit. Patients who are not entered within this time period, may be subjected to an additional medical assessment and/or clinical measurements to confirm their eligibility.
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, are not permitted.
6.1. Inclusion Criteria
Patients are eligible for inclusion in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria at screening and/or enrollment:
[1] are male or female patients with T2DM for at least 1 year . A diagnosis of T2DM is based on medical history.
a. Male patients:
i. No male contraception required except in compliance with specific local government requirements.
b. Female patients:
i. Women of child-bearing potential who are abstinent (if this is complete abstinence, as their preferred and usual lifestyle) or in a same sex relationship (as part of their preferred and usual lifestyle) must agree to either remain abstinent or stay in a same sex relationship without sexual relationships with males.
ii. Otherwise, women of child-bearing potential participating must agree to use 1 highly effective method of contraception until discharge from final treatment period.
1. Women of child bearing potential must test negative for pregnancy prior to initiation of treatment as indicated by a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening visit followed by a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to exposure in Period 1.
2. A highly effective method of contraception includes a combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception administered orally, intravaginally, or transdermally and is associated with inhibition of ovulation. Alternatively, patients may use either an intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion , or the partner should have been vasectomised.

1. infertile due to surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy), congenital anomaly such as Mullerian agenesis ; or
2. post-menopausal – defined as a woman being amenorrheic for more than 1 year without an alternative medical cause and a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level compatible with postmenopausal status. A FSH level in the post-menopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.

6.2.1. Additional Exclusion Criteria for Inpatient Dosing Days
Patients who fulfil 1 or more inpatient dosing-day exclusion criteria will be excluded from study drug administration for that MMTT day. A single inpatient trial period can be rescheduled 1 to 14 days later. Each treatment period can only be rescheduled once. The following exclusion criteria apply to the day before each MMTT day:
[44] positive drug screen .
[45] positive pregnancy test administered on Day -1 of Period 1.

6.3. Lifestyle and/or Dietary Requirements
Throughout the study , patients may undergo medical assessments and review of compliance with requirements before continuing in the study .
6.3.1. Meals and Dietary Restrictions
Patients will be fasted (except for water) for at least 10 hours before each test meal and 8 hours prior to screening and follow-up assessments (see Section 9.5.8 for guidelines on hypoglycemia treatment). The patient will not be allowed to consume water for 2 hours after the MMTT assessment begins; however, water may be consumed freely 2 hours postmeal. While resident in the CRU, patients may not consume any food or caloric drinks other than that provided by the CRU. When not resident in the CRU, patients may resume their regular diet and should not make major changes to the dietary habits during the study . Following completion of study procedures, patients will be offered a meal. Site will record dose and time of prandial Humalog administered with end-of- study meal.
6.3.2. Caffeine , Alcohol, and Tobacco
Patients should refrain from caffeine -containing food/beverages (for example, cola, chocolate drinks, tea, coffee, energy drinks containing methylxanthine [ caffeine , theophylline , or theobromine]) for at least 12 hours before each test meal and throughout the duration of each CRU visit. No alcohol will be allowed at least 24 hours before each CRU admission (Day –1) and throughout the duration of each CRU visit. Between CRU visits, daily alcohol should not exceed 3 units for males and 2 units for females (see Section 6.2, # 32 for unit definition). No cigarette smoking will be permitted during the study .
6.3.3. Activity
Patients will be encouraged to maintain their regular exercise and insulin regimen adaptation related to exercise during the outpatient period; however, they should not undertake vigorous or prolonged exercise at least 24 hours before each dosing day at the CRU. Movement will be restricted to retain the integrity of connections to infusion(s) and the study procedures.
6.4. Screen Failures
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study may not be rescreened.
