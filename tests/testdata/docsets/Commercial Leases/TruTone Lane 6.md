Tenant agrees, promptly after completion of such work by Landlord, to proceed with reasonable diligence and at Tenant's sole cost and expense to restore, repair and replace all alterations, additions, improvements, fixtures, signs and equipment installed by Tenant and promptly reopen for business in the Premises.
11.03 Continuation of Business.
(a) Tenant agrees that during any period of reconstruction or repair of the Premises it will continue the operation of its business within the Premises to the extent practicable, in Tenant’s sole discretion. During the period from the occurrence of the casualty until Landlord's repairs are completed, Rent shall abate in the same proportion as the untenantable portion of the Premises bears to the whole thereof.
(b) No damage or destruction to the Premises will allow Tenant to surrender possession of the Premises or affect Tenant's liability for the payment of rent or any other covenant herein contained, except as may be specifically provided in this Lease. Landlord will not be obligated to commence any repair, restoration or rebuilding until insurance proceeds are received by Landlord, and Landlord's obligations hereunder will be limited to the proceeds received by Landlord under its insurance policy. In the event the Premises will be damaged, in whole or in substantial part, within the last twelve (12) months of the term of this Lease, or any extension or renewal thereof, Landlord will have the option, exercisable within thirty
( 30) days following such damage, of terminating this Lease, effective as of the date of mailing notice thereof.

12.01 Taking of Premises.
If more than thirty percent (30%) of the floor area of the Premises should be taken for any public or quasi public use under any law, ordinance, or regulation or by right of eminent domain or by private purchase in lieu thereof, then it is agreed that at the option of either party to this Lease, this Lease shall be canceled as of the date of the taking, and both parties shall be relieved of all obligations imposed by this Lease. It is expressly understood and agreed that the Tenant shall have no claim against the Landlord as a result of any such involuntary conversion, whether brought about by suit or agreement, for the cancellation of the Lease or for Tenant's leasehold interest.
12.02 Continuation of Business.
If less than thirty (40%) percent of the floor area of the Premises should be taken as aforesaid, this Lease will not terminate; however, the Rent and other charges payable hereunder during the unexpired portion of this Lease will be reduced in proportion to the area taken, effective on the date physical possession is taken by the condemning authority, and Landlord shall proceed to make all necessary repairs to the Premises in order to render and restore the same to the condition they were in prior to the taking.
12.03 Compensation. All compensation awarded for any taking (or the proceeds of a private sale in lieu thereof) of the Premises or Tenant's leasehold interest therein will belong to and be the property of Landlord, whether such damages are awarded as compensation for the diminution in value to the leasehold or to the fee of the Premises, and Tenant assigns its interest in any such award to Landlord. Landlord will have no interest in any separate award made to Tenant for Tenant's moving and relocation expenses or for the loss of Tenant's fixtures and other tangible personal property which Tenant would be entitled to remove from the Premises at the expiration of the Lease Term , provided no such separate award to Tenant will in any way diminish the award made or to be made to Landlord. ARTICLE XIII ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING
13.01 No Assignment or Sublease.
Tenant shall not assign or in any manner transfer this Lease or any estate or interest in this Lease or sublet the Premises (or any part of the Premises) without the prior written consent of Landlord. Consent by Landlord to one or more assignments or subletting shall not operate as a waiver of Landlord's rights as to any subsequent assignments and subletting.

13.02 Assignment.

Tenant agrees to look solely to the responsibility of the successor in interest of the Landlord. Any Security Deposit given by Tenant to secure performance of its obligations under this Lease shall be assigned and transferred by Landlord to a successor in interest of Landlord and Landlord shall thereby be discharged of any further obligation for the Security Deposit .
13.02 Permitted Assignments/Subleases. Notwithstanding any provision in this Lease to the contrary, so long as Tenant is not in default beyond applicable notice and cure periods at the time, Tenant may, without Landlord’s consent, but with ten (10) days ’ notice, assign this Lease or sublet the Premises to any entity to which Tenant sells or assigns some or all or the equity interests in Tenant or all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant or of its operating affiliate, or to any entity in connection with a financing transaction involving Tenant. The sale or transfer of equity interests in Tenant and/or any subtenant subleasing in accordance with the terms of this Lease shall not constitute an assignment under the terms of this Lease. Further notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, Tenant is granting to Scott Law Ortho Corp , P.C. a Texas professional corporation (the “Sublessee”), the right to use, sublease and/or occupy the Premises as necessary to operate a professional dental and orthodontics practice pursuant to its Management Services Agreement with Tenant, and Landlord hereby consents to such grant of rights to such Sublessee.

If any such taxes for which Tenant is liable are levied against Landlord, Landlord's Building or other property, or the Premises, and if Landlord elects to pay them, or if the assessed value of Landlord's Building or property is increased by inclusion of personal property and trade fixtures placed by Tenant in the Premises and Landlord elects to pay the taxes based on that increase, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand that part of the taxes attributable to Tenant's personal property and trade fixtures. ARTICLE XV EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES
15.01 Default.
The following events shall be deemed to be events of default by Tenant under this Lease:
(a) Failure of Tenant to pay when due any installment of Rent or any other sums or charges due under this Lease and such failure shall continue for a period of ten (10) days after written notice thereof to Tenant; provided, however, that Landlord shall be required to give such notice only on ( 1) time per calendar year, and thereafter Tenant will be in default for failure to pay any amount it is obligated to pay hereunder within ten (10) days after such payment is due;
(b) Failure of Tenant to comply with any term, provision, or covenant of this Lease, other than the payment of Rent, and failure to cure that breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of the breach to Tenant (unless such breach cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days , in which case Tenant shall have additional time to cure the breach so long as Tenant is diligently prosecuting such cure).
(c) Insolvency of Tenant, a transfer by Tenant in fraud of creditors, or assignment by Tenant for the benefit of creditors;
(d) Commencement by or against Tenant or guarantor of Tenant's obligations under this Lease of proceedings in bankruptcy, or for reorganization of Tenant, or for the re-adjustment of arrangement of Tenant's debts, whether under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States of America or under any other law, whether State or Federal, now or hereafter existing for the relief of debtors, or commencement of any analogous statutory or non-statutory proceeding involving Tenant; or the commencement of any such proceedings against Tenant, where such proceedings are not dismissed within thirty (30) days of filing. The acceptance by Landlord of Tenant's Rent and other charges as provided in this Lease subsequent to the occurrence of any such event of default shall be as compensation for use and occupancy of the Premises, and shall in no way constitute a waiver by Landlord of its right to exercise any of the remedies provided herein on the occurrence of any event of default;
(e) Appointment of a receiver or trustee for substantially all of Tenant's assets where such receivership or trusteeship is not terminated within thirty (30) days of such appointment; or
(f) Tenant abandons any substantial portion of the Premises or cessation of the use of the Premises for the Approved Use .
15.02 Remedies.
On the occurrence of any of such events of default by Tenant, Landlord shall have the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies without any notice or demand whatsoever:
(a) Terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord. If Tenant fails to surrender the Premises, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in Rent, enter upon and take possession of the Premises by changing locks if necessary, and lock out, expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying all or any part of the Premises without being liable for prosecution of any claim for damages. Upon the termination of this Lease, in addition to all unpaid Rent and other monetary obligations of Tenant to Landlord, Landlord will be entitled to recover, not as Rent or a penalty but as compensation for Landlord’s loss of the benefit of its bargain with Tenant, the difference between (i) an amount equal to the present value of the Rent and other sums that this Lease provides Tenant will pay for the remainder of the term hereof, and for the balance of any then effective extension of the term hereof, and (ii) the present value of the net future Rent for such period that will be or with reasonable efforts could be collected by Landlord by reletting the Premises. The foregoing present values will be calculated by discounting at the rate of 8% per annum. For purposes of determining what could be collected by Landlord by reletting under the preceding sentence, it will be assumed that Landlord is not required to relet when other comparable space in the Building is available for lease and the Landlord will not be required to incur any cost to relet, other than customary leasing commissions.
(b) Enter upon and take possession of the Premises, by changing locks if necessary, and lock out, expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying all or any part of the Premises without being liable for any claim for damages, and without causing a trespass, without being liable for any claim for damages, and without causing a termination of or forfeiture of this Lease of Tenant’s obligation to pay Rent and any other charges, and may relet the Premises on behalf of Tenant and receive directly the Rent by reason of the reletting, but the failure to so relet shall not reduce Tenant’s liability for Rents and other charges for damages. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord on demand any deficiency that may arise by reason of reletting of the Premises; further, Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord for any expenditures made by it for remodeling or repairing in order to relet the Premises. In connection with any such reletting, Landlord will not be obligated to incur any cost to relet, other than customary leasing commissions, will not be obligated to relet for less than the then market value of the Premises or to relet the Premises when other comparable rental space in the Building is available for lease, and may relet the Premises for a term to expire at the same time as, earlier than, or subsequent to, the expiration of the term hereof and/or relet all or any portion of the Premises as a part of a larger area. Landlord may retain the excess, if any, of the Rent earned from reletting the Premises over the Rent specified in this Lease.
(c) Enter upon the Premises, by changing locks if necessary, without being liable for prosecution of any claim for damages, and do whatever Tenant is obligated to do under the terms of this Lease. Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord on demand for all expenses which Landlord may incur in effecting compliance with Tenant’s obligations under this Lease; further, Tenant agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for any damages resulting to Tenant from effecting compliance with Tenant’s obligations under this subparagraph caused by the negligence of Landlord or otherwise.
(d) After an event of default by Tenant, Landlord may recover from Tenant from time to time and Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand, whether or not Landlord has relet the Premises or terminated this Lease, (i) such reasonable expenses as Landlord may incur in recovering possession of the Premises, terminating this Lease, placing the Premises in good order and condition and altering or repairing the same for reletting; (ii) all other reasonable costs and expenses (including brokerage commissions and legal fees) paid or incurred by Landlord in exercising any remedy or as a result of the event of default by Tenant; and (iii) any other reasonable amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment caused by Tenant’s failure to perform Tenant’s obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result from Tenant's failure to perform in accordance with this Lease.

This clause shall be self-operative and no further instrument of subordination need be required by any mortgagee. In confirmation of this subordination, however, Tenant shall, at Landlord's request, execute promptly any appropriate certificate or instrument that Landlord may reasonably request, provided that any beneficiary under the deed of trust or other lien for which the subordination is required agrees not to disturb Tenant’s occupancy of the Premises so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing under this Lease. In the event of the enforcement by the trustee or the beneficiary under any such mortgage or deed of trust of the remedies provided for by law or by the deed of trust, Tenant will, upon request of any person or parties succeeding to the interest of Landlord as a result of such enforcement, automatically become the Tenant of the successor in interest without change in the terms or other provisions of this Lease.
