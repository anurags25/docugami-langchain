f. Notwithstanding the above Price Increase, if CRD can demonstrate that the costs for providing the Services have materially increased, or are likely to materially increase in the coming year due to the adoption of any applicable law or regulation, or any material change in the interpretation or administration thereof, then upon notice from CRD, the Parties agree to meet in good faith and negotiate a mutually acceptable adjustment to the Fees, which compensates CRD for the change.
