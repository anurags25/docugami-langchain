At the Closing and every month during the Term thereafter, Purchaser will submit to Supplier a twelve (12) month rolling forecast of its anticipated orders for Products over each of the upcoming twelve (12) months . In order to enable Supplier to plan its supply of Products to Purchaser, each rolling forecast (including the initial forecast to be delivered at the Closing) will be submitted with a PO so that Purchaser has in effect at all times POs covering Purchaser’s demand for the Product for the three (3) months following the date of any such forecast, which such purchase order, upon acceptance by Supplier, shall constitute a binding purchase commitment.
(3) Subject to Section 4(d)(1), Supplier shall be required to accept within ten (10) business days all POs placed by Purchaser so long as the quantity of Product ordered on such PO for delivery in any month, together with the quantity of all other Product ordered by Purchaser for delivery in such month, does not exceed 150% of the quantity of such Product indicated in the most current rolling forecast for such month.
