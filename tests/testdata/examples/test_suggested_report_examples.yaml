    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, created by the Free Software Foundation in June 1991, aims to guarantee freedom to share and change free software. Key aspects include:

    Verbatim Copying: Permitted to copy and distribute this license, but altering it is not allowed.

    Freedom to Share and Change: Ensures the freedom to distribute copies of free software (charging if desired), access and modify the source code, and use parts of it in new free programs.

    Conditions for Redistribution and Use:

    Source code distributions must retain the copyright notice, list of conditions, and disclaimer.
    Binary form distributions must reproduce these notices.
    Using the name 'MagicBiblio' or its contributors for endorsement of derived products without written permission is prohibited.
    No Warranty: Provided "as is" without any warranty. Copyright holders and contributors disclaim liability for any damages arising from its use.

    Modification and Redistribution: Modified versions must be marked as changed, and the entire modified work must be licensed under the GPL.

    Distribution of Executable Form: Accompanied by source code or a written offer to provide the source code.

    License Acceptance and Compliance: Modifying or distributing the Program implies acceptance of this License. Redistribution grants the recipient a license from the original licensor under these terms.

    Patent and Copyright Infringement: License remains in effect even if distribution conflicts with patent licenses or other copyright agreements.

    Geographical Distribution Limitation: The original copyright holder may exclude certain countries.

    Versioning and Revisions: The GPL may be updated by the Free Software Foundation, with each version numbered. Users may choose to comply with the specified version or any later version.

    Incorporating GPL Software into Other Programs: Requires permission from the author, especially for software copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation.

    'Gnomovision' Example: Includes a hypothetical example of a program named 'Gnomovision' by James Hacker, illustrating how to apply the GPL terms to a program, emphasizing the absence of warranty and the conditions for redistribution.

    Prohibition on Proprietary Incorporation: This License does not permit incorporating the program into proprietary programs, suggesting the GNU Lesser General Public License for subroutine libraries.

    Applying the License: Guidelines for applying the GPL to new programs, including attaching notices, ensuring no warranty, and providing contact information.

    Employer or School Copyright Disclaimer: Suggests obtaining a disclaimer from employers or schools if necessary, with a sample provided.

    This license fundamentally ensures that free software remains free, detailing how to distribute and modify such software while protecting both the users' freedoms and the authors' rights.
